## PowerShell utility scripts
A compilation of PowerShell scripts to assist me in my pentesting activities. 

Comprises of:
* **Edit-Routes.ps1**: Add/Remove networking routes. Takes a text file containing a list of targets, information about the operation to perform (add/remove) and the type of engagement as input to edit the system networking routes. Particularly useful to route pentesting traffic via corporate VPNs.
